This is a Single Page Application served from static/mortgage.html
Using only HTML, CSS, Javascript - NO DEPENDENCIES in the site itself
UI should be dynamic with user entry and not require "calculate" buttons
We'll need a development server for user testing
The user base will be using the latest Chrome, Safari, or Firefox as at 29 March 2025
We'll need a git ignore that handles emacs files
All development is on the main trunk no PRs or branches

Testing:
- Jest can be used for unit testing the JavaScript functionality
- No external dependencies should be included in the production site
- Tests will be kept separate from the static site files
