Using the mortgage rates from https://www.hsbc.co.uk/mortgages/our-rates/ embedded in a static data file, we want to allow a user to enter:

Selling price for current property
Cash in hand at start of proceess
Current mortgage
Estate agent fee %age
Other fees
Buying price for new property


We then want to calculate for each mortgage:

Monthly repayment in initial period
Cash in hand at end of process

and show these calculated values together with the mortgage details

We'll need to validate eligibility and filter the list we show solely to eligible mortgages.
We'd like to sort the mortgages in descending order of cash in hand at end of process
